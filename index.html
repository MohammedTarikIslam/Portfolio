          I aim to gain experience in a variety of different areas of computer
          science as I have studied a broad range of topics in my degreee.
          However I believe i should gain industry experience before I solidify
          my decision. <br />
          In addition to this, I aim to master full stack develop with this
          website being one of my first projects created to achieve that goal.
          Currently, this website uses HTML and CSS using the SASS framework and
          i aim to implement REACT adn node.js as well for animations. I also
          intend to create another project which will have a focus on database
          management and data analysis as a database isnt needed for this
          project.
